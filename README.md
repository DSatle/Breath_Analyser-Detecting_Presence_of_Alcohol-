# Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol

# Objective

The objective of an alcohol detector is to accurately and reliably measure the presence of alcohol in a person's breath, blood, or other bodily fluids to promote safety and responsible behavior. This device aims to:

* Prevent Impaired Driving
* Ensure Workplace Safety
* Enhance Public Health
# Functioning of Breath Analyser

The Breath Analyser consists of the MQ3 sensor. Paired with the RISC-V processor. MQ3 sensor module has a built in LM393 precision comparator which converts the anlog signal to digital output for the RISC-V. The module includes a potentiometer for adjusting the sensitivity of the digital output (D0). You can use it to set a threshold so that when the alcohol concentration exceeds the threshold value, the module outputs LOW otherwise HIGH.

**Rotating the knob clockwise increases sensitivity and counterclockwise decreases it.**

**Setting the threshold**

The module has a built-in potentiometer for setting an alcohol concentration threshold above which the module outputs LOW and the status LED lights up.

Now, to set the threshold, let the alcohol vapors enter the sensor and turn the pot clockwise until the Status LED is on. Then, turn the pot back counterclockwise just until the LED goes off.

Thatâ€™s all there is to it; your module is now ready to use.

The block diagram of the breath analyser is given below.

# Spike Simulation Results
The output of the spike is shown below where sensor value =1, indicates Presence of Alcohol is detected and buzzer is turned on i.e buzzer =1, contrary to that if presence of alcohol is not detect buzzer is off, the image shows output as 2 whose binary equivalent is 10. 

![spike_output](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/9c5ab018-9db1-4046-a99f-8b92c70a4639)

# Functional Simulation's Conclusive Data

The below image shows the change in output with respect to change in input. Low value of input indicates that the alcohol consumption is under permissable limmit  and buzzer is off i.e output is also low, contrary to that when the person has drunk above permissible limit output of the sensor which is input to the processor is high and buzzer is turned on.

## Gate level Simulation

To perform the gate level simulation following commands were used

```
read_liberty -lib sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib 
read_verilog processor.v 
synth -top wrapper
dfflibmap -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib 
abc -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib
write_verilog Synth_test.v
```
To run the GLS command following commands were used 

```
iverilog -o test synth_processor_test.v testbench.v sky130_sram_1kbyte_1rw1r_32x256_8.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v primitives.v
```


The same results i.e. output following input is replicated in the Gate level Simulation with instruction ID and delay.

The first image shows the output following input.

# Placement 

* Placement is the process of placing standard cell in the design, the tool determines the location of each standard cell on the die, the tool places these on basis of algorithm which it uses internally.

* Placement does not just place the standard cells available in the synthesized netlist, it also optimizes the design, placement also determines the routability of the design.

* Placement will be driven by the different criteria like timing driven, congestion driven and power optimisation.

# Routing 

* Routing is the stage after CTS, routing is nothing but connecting the various blocks with one another.
* Routing creates physical connections to all clock and the signal pins through metal interconnects
* After CTS, we have information about the exact location of placed cells, blockages, clock tree buffers/invertes I/O pins. The tool depends on this information to electrically complete all connections
* In routing stage, metal and visas are used to create the electrical connection in layout, to complete all connetions defined by the netlist.
```

# Word of thanks

I want to extend my appreciation to Kunal Ghosh(Founder & CEO VSD) for affording me the opportunity to learn about the ASIC design flow through his provision of high-quality educational materials.

I would also like to express my gratitude to Mayank Kabra(Founder, Chipcron Pvt. Ltd.) for his invaluable contributions and insights during the project's completion.
