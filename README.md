# Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol

# Objective

The objective of an alcohol detector is to accurately and reliably measure the presence of alcohol in a person's breath, blood, or other bodily fluids to promote safety and responsible behavior. This device aims to:

* Prevent Impaired Driving
* Ensure Workplace Safety
* Enhance Public Health
# Functioning of Breath Analyser

The Breath Analyser consists of the MQ3 sensor. Paired with the RISC-V processor. MQ3 sensor module has a built in LM393 precision comparator which converts the anlog signal to digital output for the RISC-V. The module includes a potentiometer for adjusting the sensitivity of the digital output (D0). You can use it to set a threshold so that when the alcohol concentration exceeds the threshold value, the module outputs LOW otherwise HIGH.

**Rotating the knob clockwise increases sensitivity and counterclockwise decreases it.**

**Setting the threshold**

The module has a built-in potentiometer for setting an alcohol concentration threshold above which the module outputs LOW and the status LED lights up.

Now, to set the threshold, let the alcohol vapors enter the sensor and turn the pot clockwise until the Status LED is on. Then, turn the pot back counterclockwise just until the LED goes off.

Thatâ€™s all there is to it; your module is now ready to use.

The block diagram of the breath analyser is given below.

# Output of the C program is shown below

# Spike Simulation Results
The output of the spike is shown below where sensor value =1, indicates Presence of Alcohol is detected and buzzer is turned on i.e buzzer =1, contrary to that if presence of alcohol is not detect buzzer is off, the image shows output as 2 whose binary equivalent is 10. 

![spike_output](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/9c5ab018-9db1-4046-a99f-8b92c70a4639)

# Functional Simulation's Conclusive Data

The below image shows the change in output with respect to change in input. Low value of input indicates that the alcohol consumption is under permissable limmit  and buzzer is off i.e output is also low, contrary to that when the person has drunk above permissible limit output of the sensor which is input to the processor is high and buzzer is turned on.

| Input value with time stamp| Output Value with time stamp | Delay|
| :---                       |     :---:                    | ---: |
| 1(4500Sec)                 |  1(4530Sec)                  |30 Sec|
| 0(5000Sec)                 | 0(5050Sec)                   | 50Sec|

## Gate level Simulation

To perform the gate level simulation following commands were used

```
read_liberty -lib sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib 
read_verilog processor.v 
synth -top wrapper
dfflibmap -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib 
abc -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80_256.lib
write_verilog Synth_test.v
```
To run the GLS command following commands were used 

```
iverilog -o test synth_processor_test.v testbench.v sky130_sram_1kbyte_1rw1r_32x256_8.v sky130_fd_sc_hd.v primitives.v
```


The same results i.e. output following input is replicated in the Gate level Simulation with instruction ID and delay.

The first image shows the output following input.

![1](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/bd26a9f4-0ee3-4cb1-8fa9-8d213a26df13)

The below image includes instruction ID, write done signals as well.

![2](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/05fc8713-9bf7-4059-996f-2aa4e7c4f87c)

The above two images shows a 20 sec delay which processor takes to ammend the output change with respect to input change, first output is rising after input rises, second output falls after input falls.
# Netlist Generation
To generate the netlist following commands were used 
```
show wrapper
```
Below image shows the netlist generated with highlighted wrapper module.

# OpenLane

To run Openlane following commands were used in the terminal.

```
make mount
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
prep -design project
```
![flow_interactive](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/9012fbf6-0558-445f-a161-da83a903f4cf)

# Synthesis

Synthesis is the process of transfering higher level of abstraction(RTL) to implementable lower level of abstraction. It is the process of transforming RTL to gate-level netlist.

Synthesis = Translation + Logic Optimisation + Mapping

```
run_synthesis
```

# Floorplan 

Floor planning is the first step in the physical design flow. Floor Planning is a quintessential step which decides the layout of the VLSI design. A good floorplan can be make implementation process (place, cts, route & timing closure) cake walk.

```

# Placement 

* Placement is the process of placing standard cell in the design, the tool determines the location of each standard cell on the die, the tool places these on basis of algorithm which it uses internally.

* Placement does not just place the standard cells available in the synthesized netlist, it also optimizes the design, placement also determines the routability of the design.

* Placement will be driven by the different criteria like timing driven, congestion driven and power optimisation.

```
run_placement
