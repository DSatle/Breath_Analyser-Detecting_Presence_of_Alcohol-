# Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol

# Objective

The objective of an alcohol detector is to accurately and reliably measure the presence of alcohol in a person's breath, blood, or other bodily fluids to promote safety and responsible behavior. This device aims to:

* Prevent Impaired Driving
* Ensure Workplace Safety
* Enhance Public Health
# Functioning of Breath Analyser

The Breath Analyser consists of the MQ3 sensor. Paired with the RISC-V processor. MQ3 sensor module has a built in LM393 precision comparator which converts the anlog signal to digital output for the RISC-V. The module includes a potentiometer for adjusting the sensitivity of the digital output (D0). You can use it to set a threshold so that when the alcohol concentration exceeds the threshold value, the module outputs LOW otherwise HIGH.

**Rotating the knob clockwise increases sensitivity and counterclockwise decreases it.**

**Setting the threshold**

The module has a built-in potentiometer for setting an alcohol concentration threshold above which the module outputs LOW and the status LED lights up.

Now, to set the threshold, let the alcohol vapors enter the sensor and turn the pot clockwise until the Status LED is on. Then, turn the pot back counterclockwise just until the LED goes off.

Thatâ€™s all there is to it; your module is now ready to use.

The block diagram of the breath analyser is given below.

# Output of the C program is shown below

![output trail](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/29d77cfc-01af-460d-bc74-e443109d0dc8)


# Spike Simulation Results
The output of the spike is shown below where sensor value =1, indicates Presence of Alcohol is detected and buzzer is turned on i.e buzzer =1, contrary to that if presence of alcohol is not detect buzzer is off, the image shows output as 2 whose binary equivalent is 10. 

![spike_output](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/9c5ab018-9db1-4046-a99f-8b92c70a4639)

# Functional Simulation's Conclusive Data

In the image below, it's evident that the ID_instructions' content is incrementing in a manner that mirrors the progression of the assembly code, aligning with the PC's execution increment

![3](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/d35501eb-488f-4644-a3f8-b7f69d190f2a)

The image provided below demonstrates that when the "write done" signal is in a low state, the operation remains unexecuted since the instruction isn't fetched. As a result, any input variation does not affect the output, and it remains constant.

![2](https://github.com/DSatle/Breath_Analyser-Detecting_Presence_of_Alcohol-/assets/140998466/5b49e79d-1468-4324-a9bc-8f91b2a04444)

The image reveals a variation in the output corresponding to changes in the input. This is attributed to the "write done" signal being in a high state, indicating that an instruction has been successfully fetched, and as a result, the operation is executed.
When the input is in a high state, it signifies that the alcohol level surpasses the allowable limit, causing an increase in the output signal and subsequently turning on the buzzer.

# Word of thanks

I want to extend my appreciation to Kunal Ghosh(Founder & CEO VSD) for affording me the opportunity to learn about the ASIC design flow through his provision of high-quality educational materials.

I would also like to express my gratitude to Mayank Kabra for his invaluable contributions and insights during the project's completion.
